this script is provided as is. To use it enter information of source svn repo directly into the script (or extract parameters and create a merge request ;) 
). On the first run add any param e.g. `./gitsvnClone.sh bla` when you have to interrupt the migration and want to continue the migration just run without param again `gitsvnClone.sh`
